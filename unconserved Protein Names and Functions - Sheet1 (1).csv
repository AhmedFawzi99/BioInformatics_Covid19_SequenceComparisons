37,S,surface glycoprotein,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include spike or surface glycoprotein (S),The spike glycoprotein is found on the outside of the virus particle and gives coronavirus viruses their crown-like appearance. This glycoprotein mediates attachment of the virus particle and entry into the host cell. S protein is an important target for vaccine development, antibody therapies and diagnostic antigen-based tests."
55,N,nucleocapsid phosphoprotein,"The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope protein (E), spike or surface glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is a structural protein that binds to, protects the viral RNA genome and is involved in packaging the RNA into virus particles. The N protein has been suggested as an antiviral drug target. Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is a region of the protein sequence."
