"8,9,10,11,12,13",ORF1ab,nsp3,"host of Portein is Homo sapiens ,Organism is Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, there are some regions with functions like region Viral_protease its function is Papain like viral protease"
"15,16",ORF1ab,NSP4,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2,host is Homo sapiens there are some regions with functions like region Corona_NSP4_C Coronavirus nonstructural protein 4 C-terminus"
18,ORF1ab,3C-like proteinase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,host is Homo sapiens,there are some regions with functions like region Peptidase_C30 note on it Coronavirus endopeptidase C30"
"23,24",ORF1ab,RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,nsp12; NiRAN and RdRp; produced by pp1ab only
26,ORF1ab,helicase,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,host is Homo sapiens,there are some regions with functions like region DEXXQc_Upf1-like note on it DEXXQ-box helicase domain of Upf1-like helicase"
29,ORF1ab,3'-to-5' exonuclease,"3'-to-5' exonuclease note=""nsp14A2_ExoN and nsp14B_NMT; produced by pp1ab only"
"33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40",S,surface glycoprotein,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include spike or surface glycoprotein (S),The spike glycoprotein is found on the outside of the virus particle and gives coronavirus viruses their crown-like appearance. This glycoprotein mediates attachment of the virus particle and entry into the host cell. S protein is an important target for vaccine development, antibody therapies and diagnostic antigen-based tests."
43,E,envelope protein," The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope protein (E), spike or surface glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The envelope protein is found in virus particles. This protein facilitates assembly and release of the virus and has ion channel activity required for pathogenesis."
45,M,membrane glycoprotein,"The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope protein (E), spike or surface glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The membrane protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein, is the most abundant structural protein in the virus particle and has been suggested as an antiviral drug target."
"48,49",ORF8,ORF8 protein,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes coronavirus disease,Once inside the cell the infecting RNA is used to encode structural proteins that make up virus particles, nonstructural proteins that direct virus assembly, transcription, replication and host control and accessory proteins whose function has not been determined."
"52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58",N,nucleocapsid phosphoprotein,"The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope protein (E), spike or surface glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is a structural protein that binds to, protects the viral RNA genome and is involved in packaging the RNA into virus particles. The N protein has been suggested as an antiviral drug target. Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is a region of the protein sequence."
